# Wind Turbine Power Predictor

This project involves the development of a machine learning model to predict the power output of a wind turbine. The model utilizes environmental data such as wind speed, wind direction, and theoretical power curves to optimize wind turbine performance and enhance energy production efficiency. The prediction model is deployed in a web application that allows users to access power output predictions, helping them make informed decisions for sustainable utilization of renewable energy resources.
